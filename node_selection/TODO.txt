add designs choice DETAILS and problems
--------------------

details:

- node detection. how to 'ensure' to reach all nodes
  send disseminate
  wait for nodes to respond (time is configurable)

problems:
  disseminate sends after reset
  ctp find out packet size

---------------------------
todo
---------------------------

- assign the sender which should send measurements
- make channel configurable
- define channels to go to
- define collection channel
- make channel switching the outer loop ( maybe )
AMSend.sendDone -> use state machine

parameters to support
- delays (channel switching, wait for node ids, ...)
- num measurements
- channels
