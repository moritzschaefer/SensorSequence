add designs choice DETAILS and problems
--------------------

details:

- node detection. how to 'ensure' to reach all nodes
  send disseminate
  wait for nodes to respond (time is configurable)

- ResetTimer for going back to start channel
- we send always the same amount of measurements to go on..
- Timer if not all measurements received

- channel wait times..


problems:
  disseminate sends after reset
  ctp find out packet size
  After Channel switch some still waited and didn't switch channel, missed next measurements and next channel switch.
  ctp receive cancels transmitting to pc. solution: as sink node first send own data(to clear the buffer) to pc. then receive one node after another their data. fill own buffer with them und transfer to pc
  why is channel switch inner loop? cause of space for measurements
  why data_sender_selection? ctp packet interference!

Testing with channel wait times: 120/60 works (why double 60? explain! other ideas?). 120/30 works 120/5 works (no multi hop). 50/20 works. 30/15 failed 30/5 works. conclusion: there has to be difference between sender channel waiting and normal channel waiting of 20+ms to work properly.
recommendation though is waiting

---------------------------
todo
---------------------------
- Data to file!
- GUI/Configuration file
- configura channels!!



- make channel configurable
- define channels to go to
- define collection channel
- make channel switching the outer loop ( maybe ) please dont
AMSend.sendDone -> use state machine
- use another timer for resetting channel to 11!!
parameters to support
- num measurements
- channels

MAX: ändere alle snake_case zu camelCase (außer in host_controller.py) und außer die measurement_data_t und serial_control_t
